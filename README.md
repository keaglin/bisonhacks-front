# Where It Matters

### About
Where it matters is an application that allows users to find organizations that contribute a larger percentage of resources to the people that need them. Many large organizations give high salaries to many of their c-level executives that account for a large percentage of monetary donations. We hope to empower users to ensure that when they donate their time and money, they can make it count.

### Future Features
Map API & Search: Allow you to search by name, city, state, zip code, category, type of organization.
API Changes: We had some issues with the API that we used last minute and the responses that it's sending. We also found a better API during the beginning of this project that was down and we have contacted them about the issue.

### Reflection
We created this app to help ensure that resources were getting into the hands of people that truly needed them. Seeing organizations pump hundreds of thousands and even millions into the c-level executive's pockets and re-selling resources for a profit is something that pulled heavy at our hearts. While working in the environment of a hackathon time and resources are limited, we plan on continuing the growth of this project to help alleviate issues in our community, as well as ensure that when people who are better off go to help, that they actually make it count.
